# We can concatenate strings with a '+' if they are both strings
print(myString + "_I_love_Python!")

# However, operators often don't know how to mix data types
print(myString+3)

# We can fix this by making them the same data type on the fly - typecasting
print(myString+str(3))


GitHub- setup

-http://burnedpixel.com/blog/beginners-setup-guide-for-ruby-node-git-github-on-your-mac/

-installing homebrew 
	ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
-manually un-installed git because it was installed in usr/bin instead of usr/local
-installing version 2.2.1

		myString.startswith('h')
	You can do two things at once
