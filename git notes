How to push updates from computer::
$git push origin master

if you have added a file on the computer. there might be an easier way to do all of this:
  $git add /file_you_made
  $git commit -m "notes that are added for this version"
  -m pushes to master branch (i think).  
  -a adds all new files with same info in quotations. if you only add info to one file you can flag this instead of doing the add command
  $git push origin master
