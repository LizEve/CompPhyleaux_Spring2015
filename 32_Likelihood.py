Sometimes it will not be feasible or efficient to calculate the likelihoods for every
value of a parameter in which we're interested. Also, that approach can lead to large
gaps between relevant values of the parameter. Instead, we'd like to have a 'hill
climbing' function that starts with some arbitrary value of the parameter and finds
values with progressively better likelihood scores. This is an ML optimization
function. There has been a lot of work on the best way to do this. We're going to try
a fairly simple approach that should still work pretty well, as long as our likelihood 
surface is unimodal (has just one peak). Our algorithm will be:
(1) Calculate the likelihood for our starting parameter value (we'll call this pCurr)
(2) Calculate likelihoods for the two parameter values above (pUp) and below (pDown)
our current value by some amount (diff). So, pUp=pCurr+diff and pDown=pCurr-diff. To
start, set diff=0.1, although it would be nice to allow this initial value to be set
as an argument of our optimization function.
(3) If either pUp or pDown has a better likelihood than pCurr, change pCurr to this
value. Then repeat (1)-(3) until pCurr has a higher likelihood than both pUp and
pDown.
(4) Once L(pCurr) > L(pUp) and L(pCurr) > L(pDown), reduce diff by 1/2. Then repeat
(1)-(3).
(5) Repeat (1)-(4) until diff is less than some threshold (say, 0.001).
(6) Return the final optimized parameter value.
Write a function that takes some starting p value and observed data (k,n) for a
binomial as its arguments and returns the ML value for p.
To write this function, you will probably want to use while loops. The structure of
these loops is
while (someCondition):
    code line 1 inside loop
    code line 2 inside loop
    
As long as the condition remains True, the loop will continue executing. If the
condition isn't met (someCondition=False) when the loop is first encountered, the 
code inside will never execute.
If you understand recursion, you can use it to save some lines in this code, but it's
not necessary to create a working function.

"""
In the exercise above, you tried to find an intuitive cutoff for likelihood ratio
scores that would give you a reasonable interval in which to find the true value of 
p. Now, we will empirically determine one way to construct such an interval. To do 
so, we will ask how far away from the true value of a parameter the ML estimate 
might stray. Use this procedure: (1) start with a known value for p, (2) simulate
a bunch of datasets, (3) find ML parameter estimates for each simulation, and then 
(4) calculate the likelihood ratios comparing the true parameter values and the ML
estimates. When you do this, you will be constructing a null distribution of
likelihood ratios that might be expected if the value of p you picked in (1)
was true. Note that the ML values for these replicates are very often greater than
L(true value of P), because the ML value can only ever be >= L(true value). Once 
you have this distribution, find the likelihood ratio cutoff you need to ensure 
that the probability of seeing an LR score that big or greater is <= 5%.
